# Reinforcment Learning Final Project

This is the final (mini) project, in the course Topics In Reinforcment learning, made by Meir Yagayev and Bar Siman Tov.
In the course we solved 3 problems from OpenAI's Gym:

### 1 - Black Jack
An introduction assignment, using a table.

### 2 - Cart Pole
Solved using the SARSA algorithm, using all the features from the observation, as well as the accelerations(calculated as the difference between the last 2 velocities).

## 3 - Lunar Landing
This is the main project. 
Solved using Deep Learning, withe Keras and Tensorflow backend.
